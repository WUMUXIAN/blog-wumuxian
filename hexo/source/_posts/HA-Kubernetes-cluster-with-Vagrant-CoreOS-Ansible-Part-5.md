In the [last part]("http://blog.wumuxian1988.com/2018/01/12/HA-Kubernetes-cluster-with-Vagrant-CoreOS-Ansible-Part-4/"), we have managed to deploy the Kubernetes core components using bootbuke and be able to access to cluster using the dashboard. We'll know use an example to demonstrate the deployment of services and expose the services using Ingress and route traffic by domain name.
